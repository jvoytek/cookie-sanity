# Cookie Sanity

Cookie Sanity is a volunteer-built app designed to simplify and streamline the chaos of cookie season. The tools provided by GSUSA, the cookie bakers and local councils are confusing, overly complicated, and missing key features that volunteers have been requesting for years. Cookie Sanity fills in those gaps.

This app solves real, everyday problems that troop leaders, troop cookie managers, and parents face—like unclear inventory tracking, poor user interfaces, missing reports, and inventory forecasting. Cookie Sanity replaces your personal spreadsheets, with a clean, intuitive interface that’s actually built for the way volunteers work.

By eliminating frustration and making cookie management faster and easier, Cookie Sanity gives volunteers back what they need most: time and peace of mind. It helps troops stay organized, reduces errors, and makes the cookie season less stressful and more successful—for everyone.

You've found the public repository of source code for this project. If you would like to contribute to the project please read on. If you're looking for the app to use for your cookie season please check back in December 2025 when we hope to launch.
